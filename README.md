## About Project üëã

This app was developed as a part of the 6-week Chingu Voyage 51 around September 2024. The purpose of the app is to solve the problem of splitting expenses with a group of friends or any number of people. In this app, the user is supposed to be able to create groups, input expenses/budget, add/remove friends, and many more functionalities. However, due to the complexity of the app logic and time constraints, the team did not manage to fully implement all the features, therefore it remains to be revisited and completed post voyage.

## Features üë®‚Äçüíª

- Add/remove/edit groups

- Add/remove group members

- Add/update group expenses and budget

- Toggle dark/light mode across the app

- Be able to select different groups, from the sidebar and the homepage as well

- Edit how much percent each member contributes to the expense

---

## How it works ‚öôÔ∏è

- Upon entering the app, the user sees a homepage and a sidebar on the left.

- On this homepage, the user can:

  1.  Create a new group.
  2.  Remove an existing group.
  3.  Open details of the default group always present.
  4.  Search groups, if there are many groups.

- Then the user can open group details by clicking a button insise a group card, for that specific group.

- The user is now on a dedicated group page with all the details for that group.

- From there, the user can do many things, such as:

  1.  Edit group's name and image.
  2.  Edit the group's budget and total expense.
  3.  Add or remove members to the group .
  4.  Assign different pictures to new members, if no picture is selected, a default picture will be assigned to member.
  5.  See the contributions of the members to total expense. By default all members contribute equally.
  6.  Edit contributions so that some members can contribute more and some less.
