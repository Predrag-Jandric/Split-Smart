## About Project

Split Wise is an application designed to simplify splitting expenses among friends, family, or colleagues. Whether you're planning a trip, organizing a group dinner, or managing shared expenses, Split Wise helps you keep track of who owes what and ensures that everyone pays their fair share.

Split Wise was built using React + Vite. It is only a front-end app, so it doesn't have a database or a backend. For more technical details for developers, see section _Technologies & Dependencies used_. The app was built by a team of 6, during a 6 week time period, see more in the section _Team_

## How it works

- Upon entering the app, the user sees a homepage and a sidebar on the left.

- On this homepage, the user can:

  1.  Create a new group.
  2.  Remove an existing group.
  3.  Open details of the default group always present.
  4.  Search groups, if there are any groups.

- Then the user can open group details by clicking "Details" button on Homepage, to see that specific group's details.

- The user is now on a dedicated group page with all the details for that group.

- From there, the user can do many things, such as:

  1.  Edit group's name, description and image.
  2.  Edit the group's budget and total expense.
  3.  Add or remove members to the group.
  4.  Assign different pictures to new members, if no picture is selected, a default picture will be assigned to member.
  5.  See the contributions of the members to total expense ratio. By default all members contribute equally.
  6.  Edit contributions so that some members can contribute more and some less.
